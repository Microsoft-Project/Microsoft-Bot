# Github Issue-Label Prediction Application
LabelBot is a Github application that can be used to automatically tag an issue with a Github label. It uses machine learning to read the comment body and title to estimate what the issue might be about, and then labels the issue following publishing a short comment notifying the issue creator of the same.  As of now, the LabelBot is capable of classifying an issue as a ‘question’, ‘bug’ or ‘enhancement’. 
#In Action
