## Code of conduct

#### Project plan:

Our project plan is closely based off the papers and requirements provided by the Microsoft Seattle Research team.

* Each requirement will be dealt with as a feature, where issues will be made and milestones will be implemented with a duedate.

* Milestones are split into activities that are based off the steps necessary to fulfill the feature

* Activities are distributed among team members during sprint planning

* Progress is tracked through GitHub (issues and milestones), GitHub Project boards and our regular communication in and outside our scheduled stand-up meetings 


#### How do we plan to collaborate?
* Regular meetings will be held online over Zoom.

* Sprints last a week and will be set up with a sprint backlog on GitHub containing work items to make it easier to allocate tasks.

* We will use Scrum and utilize GitHub to allocate our selves to tasks.

##### Sprint schedule: 

###### Monday: Mid Sprint meeting and work session
* Time: 12:00-13:00

* Agenda:
1. The members present their progress of the work item previously assigned to them.
2. Ask questions (if any)
3. Work on the taks.

###### Tuesday: Work with assigned tasks
* Time: flexible

###### Wednesday: PO preparation meeting and retrospective
* Time: flexible

* Agenda:
1. Prepare what is to be presented for the PO's
2. Summarize sprint

###### Thursday: PO meeting & Sprint Planning
* Time: 18:30-20:00

* Agenda:
1. The members present their progress to the PO's and answer PO's questions.
2. The members ask PO's if they have any questions.
3. Sprits are summed up after PO meeting.
2. Unforeseen difficulties shall be discussed and documented, in case they occured.    
3. Agree on the outcome of the incoming sprint.
4. Assign members with work items from the backlog.
5. Discuss possible risks related to the work items (if any) and how to address them properly and efficiently.

###### Friday: Work with assigned tasks
* Time: flexible

###### Weekends: Vacation

______

#### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
* A Github board for visualizing work items of a sprint and their status.
* The regular meetings.
* Whatsapp Messages.

* Our definition of done contains that code is peer-reviewed. Individual contributions therefore need to be committed upon the agreed internal deadline to allow for other team-members to review them. This will improve code quality and ensure a general understanding of all parts of our project. If extensions are needed for a feature, it will be discussed and agreed on when feasible. 

* There are multiple factors that can cause a task to be delayed. There are few things we need to do to address and mitigate unexpected delays:
    * We need to track the team progress regularly.
    * Keep a regular communication flow.
* On Thursdays we will assign tasks that will last for a week, a Sprint. These tasks will then be progress checked on Monday where we need a small presentation of the progress: 
    * If the progress is slow, or there are circumstances that we as a team feel will hinder achievement of this task on time, we will allocate more resources in the form of time and manpower in that one task.
    * If the task is delayed, we need to evaluate the reason why, whether it is that the scope of that task was too big, or the effort was low etc. once identified we need to place measures to prevent this from happening again.

______

#### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
* We ensure knowledge transfer through sharing required information sources on our communication platforms and addressing any issues in related meetings.

* We will use code review at the end of each sprint where contributors have to be able to explain and justify their implemented methods.  

______

#### What is our usual communication plan?

We are planning to have fixed meetings thorughout week (see [sprint schedule](#sprint-schedule)). These meetings will be held on a dedicated Zoom call.

Besides these meetings we are available for communication via text (simple questions) and voice-chat (further discussions, collaboration, fixing issues, coding sessions) on Zoom.

Our sprintboard on GitHub and the progress in the GitHub repository will help us monitor the project progress in between meetings.

Summarised, we will be communicating via the following channels:
- Zoom
- A dedicated Whatsapp group
- Github

______

#### How will we solve conflicts? 

* Responsibilities are divided so we need to ensure each member understands their task. Each member will be responsible to be honest with the group and if members are stuck, the issue should be resolved before the deadline of the task. 

* Each member is responsible for showing up to the meetings that are in place and shall communicate in case they cannot join. In cases where a member misses meetings regularly or does not communicate about it, the procedures to be taken will be discussed and considered to take place after consulting the course organizer.

* In case of a conflict between two members, the two will have to communicate directly to each other in a constructive manner. If the conflict is not resolved, the team should get involved to find a solution to the issue. If the team's opinion is split, the team will ask for an additional opinion outside of the team, most likely course organizer, and if it still is not resolved, a random draw will be made to randomly select a solution and the team has to accept the outcome.

#### Agreed by

We have all agreed to adhere to this code of conduct and will sign this with a commit adding our names:
